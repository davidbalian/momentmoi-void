## ðŸ’¡ Development Philosophy

**Start Simple:**

- Build core functionality first
- Add complexity incrementally
- Focus on user value over feature richness
- Test with real users early and often

**Technical Debt Management:**

- Code for current requirements, not future complexity
- Refactor when adding new features
- Maintain clean, readable code
- Document architectural decisions

This simplified roadmap focuses on delivering a working product quickly while maintaining the foundation for future growth.
